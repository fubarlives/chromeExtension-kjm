### Thanks and props to https://dev.to/anobjectisa for so many great articles and youTube videos on Chrome Extension Development


Use:
    run  npm -install
    run npm build:prod  // this will create a production build and put the files into the dist folder

    Using Chrome Extensions in Developer mode you then install into chrome browser using "load unpacked" process
